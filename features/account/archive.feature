    Scenario: Old user archives are purged
        Given the following profiles exist:
            | email               | attributes | requirements | city   | age |
            | newuser@example.com | man        | woman        | London | 30  |
        And I create an old archive for "newuser@example.com"
        And I run the purge user archives command
        Then there should not be an archive for "newuser@example.com"
